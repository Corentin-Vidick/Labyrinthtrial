# P4 JSDOGTRAINING

JSTraining is a website designed for a dog trainer's clients to book training sessions. The website describes what type of classes are on offer, gives a chance to the client to create an account and book a session.
Users can see their bookings and delete them. They can also create, edit and delete a profile which, if created, will fill the booking form automatically with their address, phone number... Users can also send a message to the admin through the "Contact us" button.
The trainer (as an admin) can create sessions (day and time), delete booked sessions, view users' profile and view and delete messages from the "Contact us" form.

## UX

In order to design the page I spoke with a dog trainer to get information on what kind of data and functionalities he would like on his page. I also created a persona which had interest but no knowledge about dog trainng classes nor any particular computer skills. The website had to be self-explanatory and easy to follow from page to ge, clearly marking the required actions.
I settled on a main page, a booking and profile section and a contact form. Inspiration for the main page was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0db5kA4BfQ&list=PLqr9So6FmE4M6tS1LvpokGKp_lp56XFF6&index=8&t=300s&ab_channel=TheWebsiteArchitect .

### Colour Scheme

For the colour palette I wanted something that would remind nature and hope. My primary colour is yellow as it represents happiness, optimism and positivity, and green as my secondary colour as it evokes harmony, growth and safety.

- `#F6F0A2` used for primary background colour.
- `#F15A09` used for primary text.
- `#154636` used for secondary background colour.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/154636-69b7e1-64d373-f6f0a2-f15a09) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

Two fonts were used to create this website:

- A fun and "messy" (to match untrained dogs) font for the main headers and titles
[Black And White Picture](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Black+And+White+Picture)

- A more serious but still inviting font for the text and links
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sansita)

Font awesome icons were used for the social media icons in the footer.
